### Project Overview
The **My Home Credit Philippines Loan Management App** is a comprehensive platform that allows users to manage their loan accounts, make payments, and access various financial services. As part of the **major overhaul of the app**, I worked on **enhancing existing features** and introducing **new capabilities**, such as **biometric authentication**, **eKYC (electronic Know Your Customer)**, and **real-time analytics**.

The app serves millions of users, with over **10 million downloads** and a **4.4★ rating** on the Google Play Store. My contributions were integral to modernizing the app’s functionality and improving the **user experience**, especially in terms of **security** and **onboarding**.

### My Role & Responsibilities
I was part of a cross-functional team that played a significant role in the app's **feature overhaul** and the introduction of **new functionalities**. My responsibilities included:
- **User Profile & Account Management**: Developed and optimized the **user profile management** and **account settings** features, making it easier for users to manage their accounts securely.
- **Biometric Authentication**: Implemented **2-factor authentication (2FA)** for logging in with a new device, as well as **fingerprint** and **face recognition** for user authentication.
- **eKYC Features**: Led the development of **eKYC (electronic Know Your Customer)** features, including **ID scanning**, **selfie verification**, and **liveness confirmation**, ensuring compliance with local regulations while providing a smooth user experience.
- **App Analytics**: Integrated **Firebase** for real-time **app event tracking** and analytics, enabling the team to monitor user interactions and optimize the app's performance based on data insights.
- **Modular Architecture**: Converted the app’s architecture from a **monolithic** structure to a **modularized architecture**, improving scalability and simplifying the maintenance of different app components.
- **On-call Support**: Provided dedicated **on-call support** during key app releases, especially for features I was directly involved in, ensuring smooth deployment and bug resolution.
