### Project Overview
The **MYSALE Group** operates a network of e-commerce applications, each tailored to specific regions and countries. As part of the **Android development team**, I helped **update, maintain, and reskin** more than ten of these applications. The project involved close collaboration with both the **iOS development team** and **graphic designers** to create region-specific looks and features, while ensuring that the underlying functionality remained consistent across the different versions of the app.

The apps were designed to handle high traffic and facilitate secure payment processing, and they required frequent updates to ensure GDPR compliance, new features, and real-time user engagement tracking.

### My Role & Responsibilities
As part of the Android team, I took on a range of responsibilities, including architecture design, feature development, and on-call support for app releases. My specific contributions included:
- **Architecture Design**: Established the appâ€™s **base architecture** using **MVP (Model-View-Presenter)** with **Conductor**, creating a scalable and maintainable codebase that could easily handle the frequent updates and changes required across the apps.
- **App Reskins**: Created **app reskins** using different build variants based on the same original code, tailoring the UI/UX to meet the unique needs of each region.
- **Feature Development**: Developed critical features, including **GDPR compliance agreement** checking and **payments integration** using **Braintree**, ensuring that the apps adhered to legal requirements and provided a seamless payment experience for users.
- **Event Tracking**: Implemented **app event tracking** using **Fabric Answers**, allowing the team to collect valuable analytics on user behavior and engagement.
- **Collaboration**: Worked closely with the **iOS development team** to ensure consistency across platforms, and collaborated with **graphic designers** to ensure the new looks aligned with the brand guidelines for each region.
- **Research & Feasibility Studies**: Partnered with another team member to conduct **research and feasibility studies**, presenting valuable insights to the team and stakeholders that helped **maximize app effectiveness** and user engagement.

### Key Achievements
- Successfully helped maintain and update over **ten Android e-commerce apps**, each tailored to a different region, ensuring they met business requirements and maintained a consistent user experience.
- Played a key role in ensuring the apps were **GDPR compliant**, allowing the company to continue operating smoothly across Europe.
- Integrated **Braintree** for secure payment processing, offering users a seamless and secure checkout experience.
- Implemented region-specific designs that enhanced the user experience while maintaining the underlying structure and functionality of the original app.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Development**: Android Studio, Java, Kotlin, Amazon S3, Firebase, Fabric Answers, Braintree
- **Project Management**: Trello, Jira, Confluence for task management, tracking progress, and collaboration with the team
- **Version Control**: Git for maintaining multiple versions of the app across different regions and ensuring a smooth release process.

### Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Managing multiple app versions across different regions while ensuring code consistency and performance.
  - **Solution**: Established a flexible, scalable **MVP architecture** using **Conductor**, which allowed us to reuse core components while easily customizing the UI for different regions.
  
- **Challenge**: Adhering to strict **GDPR compliance** and implementing secure payment systems within a tight deadline.
  - **Solution**: Collaborated closely with the legal and compliance teams to ensure all requirements were met, and integrated **Braintree** for secure and reliable payment processing.

### Conclusion
This project was a fantastic opportunity to enhance my skills in **Android development**, **collaborative development**, and **e-commerce app architecture**. The experience of managing multiple versions of the same app, ensuring compliance, and collaborating across teams to deliver region-specific features, all within a fast-paced environment, strengthened my ability to lead development efforts and make strategic decisions. 

We followed a **hybrid Scrum-Kanban approach**, using daily stand-ups to track progress, but often leaning on **Kanban boards** to prioritize tasks and handle workflows, which was effective given the dynamic nature of the project.
