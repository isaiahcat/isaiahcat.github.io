## Project Overview
This project involved developing a **web-based grade management and course registration system** for UP Rural High School, aimed at enhancing the efficiency of course registration, grade entry, tracking, and reporting for students, teachers, and administrators.

The system replaced the manual, paper-based process, allowing students to register for courses and view their grades in real time. It streamlined the entire process while ensuring data integrity, security, and accessibility for all stakeholders.

## My Role & Responsibilities
As the **Project Manager**, I was responsible for overseeing the entire project lifecycle, including:
- **Team Leadership**: Led a team of 20+ members, consisting of four team leaders, each managing five members. The team included software engineers, UI/UX designers, and QA testers.
- **Agile Methodology**: Utilized **Scrum** for sprint planning, retrospectives, and project workflows. I conducted daily stand-up meetings and weekly sprint reviews with the team and stakeholders.
- **Stakeholder Collaboration**: Worked closely with school administrators, teachers, and students to gather requirements and ensure the system met their needs.
- **Tools and Technologies**: The system was developed using **PHP (Laravel)** for the backend, **MySQL** for the database, **Bootstrap** for responsive design, and **Git** for version control.

## Key Achievements
- Successfully **delivered the project on time and within budget**, completing the system in just four months.
- The system improved grade processing and course registration efficiency by **80%**, reducing the time required for both processes.
- Provided a secure platform for grade storage and course registration with real-time access, improving transparency and accessibility for students and teachers.

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Ensuring real-time grade updates and course registration without compromising data integrity.
  - **Solution**: Developed a robust **MySQL database** with automatic backups to ensure data security and consistency.

- **Challenge**: Managing the expectations of multiple stakeholders, including administrators, teachers, and students.
  - **Solution**: Conducted frequent meetings with stakeholders, maintaining clear and aligned communication to meet their varying needs.

## Conclusion
This project allowed me to refine my **technical project management** skills, balancing stakeholder expectations, team management, and the successful delivery of a complex software solution. The system continues to serve as a vital tool for the school’s academic operations, improving the efficiency of both course registration and grade management.
