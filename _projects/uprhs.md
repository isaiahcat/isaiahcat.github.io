### Project Overview
In this project, I led the development of a **web-based grade management system** for UP Rural High School, aimed at improving the efficiency of grade entry, tracking, and reporting for teachers, administrators, and students.

The system was designed to replace the manual, paper-based process and streamline grade calculations while ensuring data integrity, security, and easy access to real-time grade information.

### My Role & Responsibilities
As the **Project Manager**, I was responsible for overseeing the entire project from conception through deployment, including:
- **Team Leadership**: Led a team of 20+ cross-functional members, consisting of software engineers, UI/UX designers, and QA testers.
- **Agile Methodology**: Utilized **Scrum** to manage project workflows, sprint planning, and retrospectives. I conducted daily stand-up meetings and weekly sprint reviews with the team and stakeholders.
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Collaborated closely with school administrators and teachers to gather requirements and ensure that the system met their needs.
- **Tools and Technologies**: The system was developed using **PHP (Laravel)** for the backend, **MySQL** for the database, **Bootstrap** for responsive design, and **Git** for version control.

### Key Achievements
- Successfully **delivered the project on time and within budget**, implementing the grade management system in just four months.
- The system improved grade processing efficiency by **80%**, reducing the time required for grade submission and calculation.
- Provided a secure platform for grade storage with real-time access for teachers and students, improving transparency and accessibility.

### Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: One of the key challenges was ensuring real-time grade updates while maintaining data integrity.
  - **Solution**: Implemented a robust **MySQL database** with automatic backups to ensure data security and consistency.
  
- **Challenge**: Managing the expectations of multiple stakeholders with varying needs.
  - **Solution**: Conducted frequent stakeholder meetings, keeping communication clear and aligned.

### Conclusion
This project allowed me to hone my **technical project management** skills by balancing stakeholder expectations, team management, and the timely delivery of a complex software solution. The system is still in use today and continues to serve as a vital tool for the schoolâ€™s academic operations.
