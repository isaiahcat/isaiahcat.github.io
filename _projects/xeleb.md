## Project Overview
Xeleb Live is an **Android live streaming application** designed to provide a seamless streaming experience for users. The app allows users to broadcast live video content, save recorded streams, and share them across various social media platforms. Built to offer a smooth and intuitive user interface, the project required strong backend integration for video storage and social sharing, making it a highly interactive platform for content creators.

## My Role & Responsibilities
As the **primary Android developer** on this project, I was responsible for the architecture, core development, and feature implementation. Specifically, my role involved:
- **App Architecture**: Developed the base structure of the app, creating a solid foundation for live streaming and video sharing functionalities.
- **Live Streaming Integration**: Implemented live video streaming using the **[Yasea RTMP client](https://github.com/begeekmyfriend/yasea)** for Android, ensuring the app could support real-time broadcasting with minimal latency.
- **Cloud Storage**: Integrated the app with **Amazon S3** for saving and storing video streams, allowing users to access their previous broadcasts from the cloud.
- **Social Media Integration**: Added the ability to share video streams via **Facebook**, **Twitter**, and **Email**, allowing users to easily distribute their content to a wider audience.
- **API Integration**: Used **Retrofit2** and **OkHttp3** to ensure seamless communication between the app and backend services, managing video uploads, retrievals, and real-time updates.
- **Project Management**: Used **Basecamp** to coordinate with cross-functional team members, manage project tasks, and track progress.

## Key Achievements
- Successfully **designed and deployed the live streaming feature** using **Yasea RTMP**, allowing users to broadcast live content in real time.
- Developed a reliable **cloud-based storage solution** using **Amazon S3**, ensuring videos were saved securely and could be accessed later by users.
- Integrated **social media sharing**, enabling users to instantly share their live streams and recorded videos across platforms like **Facebook** and **Twitter**, boosting user engagement.
- Delivered the project within the specified timeframe of just **two months**, ensuring that all core features were implemented and thoroughly tested.
