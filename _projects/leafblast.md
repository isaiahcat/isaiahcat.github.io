### Project Overview
LeafBlast is a **location-based iOS application** that provides on-demand car wash services. Customers can request a car wash at their location, track the service provider’s journey in real time, and pay directly through the app. The project was designed to deliver a seamless, user-friendly experience while utilizing real-time GPS tracking for efficient service delivery.

### My Role & Responsibilities
As one of the **two primary developers** on this project, my responsibilities included the design, development, and deployment of critical features for the app:
- **iOS Development**: Built the app from scratch, focusing on core features like **GPS tracking**, **car model selection**, and **push notifications** for service updates.
- **Agile Methodology**: Worked closely with a senior developer and project manager to employ **Kanban** and **Scrum** practices for sprint planning and daily progress monitoring.
- **User Experience Design**: Collaborated on designing a smooth **UI/UX** flow for customers, allowing them to easily select their car model, specify service preferences, and track the status of their service in real-time.
- **Backend Integration**: Integrated the app with **Stripe SDK** for secure payment processing and with **Google Maps** for precise location tracking.
- **Code Optimization**: Leveraged **Objective-C** to optimize performance, ensuring the app could handle real-time GPS data and push notifications efficiently.

### Key Achievements
- Successfully **developed and deployed the app** within a tight timeline, completing the project in just **two months**.
- Implemented **real-time GPS tracking** using **Apple Maps** and **Google Maps**, allowing customers to monitor the service provider’s location as they approached.
- Integrated **Stripe SDK** for a smooth and secure payment process, making it easy for users to pay for services directly through the app.
- Introduced push notifications to provide users with real-time updates on their car wash service status, significantly improving customer engagement and satisfaction.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Development Tools**: Xcode, Objective-C, Git, Apple Maps SDK, Google Maps SDK, Stripe SDK
- **Project Management**: Used **Kanban** to manage tasks and track daily progress, ensuring transparency and consistent delivery.
- **Version Control**: Employed **SVN** for version control, ensuring seamless collaboration between team members and maintaining code quality.

### Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Ensuring real-time GPS accuracy and smooth updates in a location-based service app.
  - **Solution**: Integrated both **Apple Maps** and **Google Maps** to ensure precise and reliable location tracking, providing users with real-time updates without delays.
  
- **Challenge**: Implementing secure in-app payments within a short development timeframe.
  - **Solution**: Successfully integrated the **Stripe SDK** for fast, secure payments while maintaining focus on user experience.

### Conclusion
This project was a valuable learning experience that strengthened my skills in **iOS development**, real-time data integration, and **agile project management**. I gained hands-on experience with **Objective-C**, **Google Maps integration**, and payment processing, and delivered a fully functional location-based service app within a short timeframe, working as part of a lean, efficient team.
