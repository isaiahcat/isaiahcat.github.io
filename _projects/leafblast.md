## Project Overview
LeafBlast is a **location-based iOS application** that provides on-demand car wash services. Customers can request a car wash at their location, track the service provider’s journey in real time, and pay directly through the app. The project focused on enhancing an existing codebase by adding new features, fixing bugs, and improving the user experience with real-time GPS tracking and secure in-app payments.

## My Role & Responsibilities
As one of the **two primary developers** on the project, I took on a dual role of developer and mentor, working closely with a junior developer to deliver key features and improvements:
- **iOS Development**: Added features such as **GPS tracking**, **car model selection**, and **push notifications** for real-time service updates, while helping guide the other developer through technical challenges.
- **Agile Methodology**: Worked closely with the project manager using **Kanban** and **Scrum** practices, utilizing **Trello** to manage sprints, track tasks, and monitor progress.
- **User Experience Improvement**: Contributed to improving the **UI/UX**, making it easier for customers to select their car model, specify service preferences, and track the status of their service in real time.
- **Backend Integration**: Integrated **Stripe SDK** for secure payment processing and **Google Maps** for precise location tracking.
- **Code Optimization**: Focused on improving the performance of existing **Objective-C** code, ensuring the app efficiently handled real-time GPS data and push notifications.

## Key Achievements
- Successfully **added new features** and resolved bugs within a short **two-month** timeframe.
- Implemented **real-time GPS tracking** using **Apple Maps** and **Google Maps**, allowing customers to track the service provider’s location with high accuracy.
- Integrated **Stripe SDK** for a seamless and secure in-app payment process, enhancing the user experience.
- Added **push notifications** to keep users updated on their service status, significantly improving customer engagement.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Development Tools**: Xcode, Objective-C, Git, Apple Maps SDK, Google Maps SDK, Stripe SDK
- **Project Management**: Utilized **Kanban** and **Trello** for task tracking and sprint management, ensuring consistent and transparent progress.
- **Version Control**: Employed **SVN** for version control to collaborate effectively and maintain code quality.

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Maintaining real-time GPS accuracy in a location-based app.
  - **Solution**: Integrated both **Apple Maps** and **Google Maps** for more reliable location tracking and real-time updates.

- **Challenge**: Implementing secure in-app payments under a tight timeline.
  - **Solution**: Successfully integrated the **Stripe SDK** for secure, seamless payment processing, prioritizing a smooth user experience.

## Conclusion
In this project, I gained valuable experience working in a mentoring capacity, helping guide another developer while contributing key features and improvements. By enhancing a pre-existing codebase and collaborating effectively using **Agile** methodologies, I strengthened my skills in **iOS development**, **real-time GPS integration**, and **payment processing**. The LeafBlast app was successfully improved, providing users with a better and more efficient car wash booking experience.
